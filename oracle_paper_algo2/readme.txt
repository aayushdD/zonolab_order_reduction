This folder contains the MATLAB implementation of the algorithm 2 of the computational geometry: theory and applications paper. The algorithm can check if a set is a zonotope and if it is, minimal representation can be found. The problem how to find the vertices to input to the algorithm. For 2D, plot function from zonolab generates the vertices which can be used. This has been applied to previously non reducible pontryagin difference examples which looked like zonotopes but could not be reduced into one.
